// a At a restaurant, you order 1 soup for $10, 3 burgers for $8 each, and 1 ice cream for $5. 
//   Use JavaScript to calculate the cost of the order.

 

// b You're at a restaurant with 2 friends (3 people in total) and make the same order as 2a. 
//   Calculate how much each person pays.



// c Calculate the total cost of a toaster ($18.50) and 2 shirts ($7.50 each). 


   
// d Calculate a 10% tax for the total in exercise 2c.

  


// e Calculate a 20% tax for the total in 2c (remember that 1% = 1 / 100, so 20% = 20 / 100 = 0.2).
//   Solutions + more exercises in description.


/* Setup: in the Amazon project, go to the home page and add a toaster ($18.99) to your cart so you have 1 basketball,
   1 t-shirt, and 1 toaster. Choose $4.99 shipping for the toaster. */

// f Calculate the cost of the products (before shipping and taxes).
// Hint: calculate in cents to avoid inaccuracies.
